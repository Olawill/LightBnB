# LightBnB Project

A simple multi-page Airbnb clone that uses a server-side Javascript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

The project allows users to search for accommodations in an online travel app. The app allows homeowners to rent out their homes to people on vacation, creating an alternative to hotels and a home away from home.

Users can view property information, book reservations, view their reservations, write reviews and rate their stay at the property.
